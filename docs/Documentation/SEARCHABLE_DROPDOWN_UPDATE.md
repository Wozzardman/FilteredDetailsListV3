# Searchable Dropdown Enhancement

## Update: v10.6.1

### Issue Resolved
Previously, when `AllowDirectTextInput` was set to `true` in the EditorConfig, the dropdown would allow direct text input on double-click, but the dropdown list itself was not searchable when opened with a single click.

### Solution Implemented
The dropdown implementation has been enhanced to use Fluent UI's `ComboBox` component instead of the standard `Dropdown` component when `AllowDirectTextInput` is enabled.

### Key Features

#### When `AllowDirectTextInput = true`:
- **Searchable Dropdown**: Type to filter options in real-time
- **Free Text Input**: Enter custom values not in the dropdown list
- **Autocomplete**: Built-in autocomplete functionality
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support including Escape to cancel

#### When `AllowDirectTextInput = false`:
- **Standard Dropdown**: Traditional dropdown behavior (selection only)
- **No Search**: Simple click-to-select interface

### Configuration Example

```json
{
  "ColumnKey": "department",
  "EditorType": "dropdown",
  "DropdownOptions": "Engineering,Sales,Marketing,HR,Finance",
  "AllowDirectTextInput": true  // Enables searchable functionality
}
```

### Benefits
1. **Improved UX**: Users can now search through long lists of options
2. **Faster Data Entry**: Type to quickly find options instead of scrolling
3. **Flexible Input**: Accept both predefined and custom values
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing configurations continue to work unchanged

### Technical Implementation
- Uses `ComboBox` component when `AllowDirectTextInput = true`
- Uses `Dropdown` component when `AllowDirectTextInput = false`
- Maintains all existing functionality and configuration options
- Auto-commits selections for seamless user experience

This enhancement makes dropdown fields much more user-friendly, especially when dealing with large lists of options.
