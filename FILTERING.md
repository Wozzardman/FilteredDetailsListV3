# Excel-like Filtering Enhancement for FilteredDetailsListV2

## Overview

The FilteredDetailsListV2 PCF component has been enhanced with comprehensive Excel-like filtering capabilities that allow users to apply complex filters to data displayed in the grid.

## New Features

### 1. **Column-Level Filtering**
- Each column can be configured to support filtering by setting the `ColFilterable` property to `true`
- Automatic filter type detection based on column data types
- Support for multiple filter types: Text, Number, Date, Boolean, and Choice

### 2. **Filter Types and Operators**

#### **Text Filters**
- Contains
- Equals  
- Not equals
- Starts with
- Ends with
- Is empty
- Is not empty

#### **Number Filters**
- Equals
- Not equals
- Greater than
- Greater than or equal
- Less than
- Less than or equal
- Is empty
- Is not empty

#### **Date Filters**
- Equals (on date)
- Not equals  
- After (greater than)
- On or after (greater than or equal)
- Before (less than)
- On or before (less than or equal)
- Is empty
- Is not empty

#### **Boolean Filters**
- Is (equals)
- Is not (not equals)

#### **Choice Filters**
- Is one of (multi-select from available values)
- Is not one of (exclusion from available values)

### 3. **Filter User Interface**

#### **Filter Icons**
- Filter icons appear in column headers when filtering is enabled
- Icons show active state when filters are applied
- Click to open filter menu for that column

#### **Filter Menu**
- Dropdown callout with filtering options
- Search functionality for choice filters
- Multiple condition support per column
- Apply, Clear, and Cancel actions

#### **Filter Bar**
- Displays active filters below the header
- Shows summary of applied filter conditions
- Quick access to edit or remove individual filters
- "Clear all" option for removing all filters

### 4. **Advanced Filtering Features**

#### **Multiple Conditions**
- Support for up to 3 conditions per column
- AND logic between conditions within a column
- AND logic between different column filters

#### **Real-time Filtering**
- Filters are applied immediately when changed
- No server round-trip required for client-side filtering
- Maintains performance with large datasets

#### **Filter Persistence**
- Filter state can be saved and restored
- Integration with PowerApps through input/output properties

## Configuration

### New Manifest Properties

#### **Input Properties**
- `EnableFiltering` (TwoOptions): Enables/disables filtering functionality
- `FilterConfiguration` (Multiple): JSON configuration for custom filter setup
- `AppliedFilters` (Multiple): JSON string of currently applied filters

#### **Output Properties**
- `FilterEventName` (SingleLine.Text): Name of the filter event triggered
- `FilterEventColumn` (SingleLine.Text): Column name that triggered the filter event
- `FilterEventValues` (Multiple): JSON string of filter values for the triggered event
- `AllFilters` (Multiple): JSON string of all currently applied filters

#### **Column Properties**
- `ColFilterable` (TwoOptions): Enables filtering for the specific column
- `ColFilterType` (SingleLine.Text): Override automatic filter type detection

### Usage in PowerApps

#### **Basic Setup**
```powerfl
// Enable filtering
FilteredDetailsList.EnableFiltering = true

// Configure columns with filtering
Table(
    {
        ColName: "name",
        ColDisplayName: "Name",
        ColWidth: 200,
        ColFilterable: true
    },
    {
        ColName: "age", 
        ColDisplayName: "Age",
        ColWidth: 100,
        ColFilterable: true,
        ColFilterType: "number"
    },
    {
        ColName: "status",
        ColDisplayName: "Status", 
        ColWidth: 120,
        ColFilterable: true,
        ColFilterType: "choice"
    }
)
```

#### **Handling Filter Events**
```powerfl
// On filter change event
If(FilteredDetailsList.FilterEventName = "FilterChanged",
    // Save filter state
    Set(currentFilters, FilteredDetailsList.AllFilters);
    
    // Optionally refresh data based on filters
    Refresh(DataSource)
)
```

#### **Applying Saved Filters**
```powerfl
// Restore previously saved filters
FilteredDetailsList.AppliedFilters = currentFilters
```

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

#### **Components**
- `FilterMenu.tsx`: Dropdown filter interface component
- `FilterBar.tsx`: Active filters display component  
- `FilterUtils.ts`: Core filtering logic and utilities
- `Filter.types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces for filter objects

#### **Core Classes**
- `FilterUtils`: Static methods for applying filters, serialization, and data analysis
- `IFilterState`: Interface for managing all active filters
- `IColumnFilter`: Interface for individual column filter configuration

#### **Integration Points**
- Enhanced `Grid.tsx` component with filter UI integration
- Updated `index.ts` main component with filter state management
- Extended manifest with new filter properties

### Performance Considerations

#### **Client-Side Filtering**
- Filters are applied in-memory for optimal performance
- No server round-trips required for basic filtering operations
- Efficient algorithms for large dataset filtering

#### **Memory Management**
- Filter state is lightweight JSON serializable objects
- Minimal impact on component memory footprint
- Optimized re-rendering with React.useMemo for computed values

#### **Scalability**
- Supports datasets up to PCF limits (5000+ records)
- Lazy evaluation of filter values for choice filters
- Efficient unique value calculation with caching

## Best Practices

### **Column Configuration**
1. Only enable filtering on columns that users actually need to filter
2. Use appropriate filter types for optimal user experience
3. Consider data cardinality when enabling choice filters

### **Performance Optimization**
1. Limit the number of simultaneously active filters
2. Use server-side filtering for very large datasets when possible
3. Consider pagination with filtering for optimal performance

### **User Experience**
1. Provide clear visual indicators for active filters
2. Use meaningful column display names in filter interfaces
3. Test filter combinations with realistic data volumes

## Migration Guide

### **Existing Components**
- Filtering is opt-in via the `EnableFiltering` property
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Backward compatible with all existing configurations

### **Required Updates**
1. Update manifest version to include new properties
2. Set `EnableFiltering = true` where filtering is desired
3. Configure `ColFilterable = true` on filterable columns
4. Handle filter events in PowerApps OnChange handlers

### **Optional Enhancements**
1. Add custom filter type overrides with `ColFilterType`
2. Implement filter persistence with `AppliedFilters` property
3. Add custom styling for filter UI elements

## Examples

### **Simple Text Filtering**
```json
{
    "name": {
        "columnName": "name",
        "filterType": "text", 
        "conditions": [{
            "field": "name",
            "operator": "contains",
            "value": "smith"
        }],
        "isActive": true
    }
}
```

### **Complex Multi-Column Filtering**
```json
{
    "status": {
        "columnName": "status",
        "filterType": "choice",
        "conditions": [{
            "field": "status", 
            "operator": "in",
            "value": ["Active", "Pending"]
        }],
        "isActive": true
    },
    "age": {
        "columnName": "age",
        "filterType": "number",
        "conditions": [{
            "field": "age",
            "operator": "gte", 
            "value": 18
        }, {
            "field": "age", 
            "operator": "lt",
            "value": 65
        }],
        "isActive": true,
        "logicalOperator": "AND"
    }
}
```

This enhancement maintains the existing functionality while adding powerful Excel-like filtering capabilities that users expect from modern data grid components.
