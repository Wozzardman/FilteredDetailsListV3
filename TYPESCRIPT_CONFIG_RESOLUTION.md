# TypeScript Configuration Resolution

## Issue
VS Code was showing TypeScript errors related to JSX compilation (`Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided`), even though the project builds and tests successfully.

## Root Cause
The issue was with VS Code's TypeScript language service not properly recognizing the JSX configuration from the PCF scripts base configuration. While the actual build process works correctly (using webpack and the PCF build pipeline), VS Code's editor was using a different TypeScript configuration context.

## Resolution
Updated the `tsconfig.json` file to explicitly include JSX and other necessary TypeScript compiler options:

```json
{
    "extends": "./node_modules/pcf-scripts/tsconfig_base.json",
    "compilerOptions": {
        "jsx": "react",
        "module": "es2015",
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "target": "es6",
        "lib": ["es2020", "dom"],
        "typeRoots": ["node_modules/@types"],
        "esModuleInterop": true,
        "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
        "strict": true,
        "strictPropertyInitialization": false,
        "skipLibCheck": true
    },
    "include": [
        "DetailsList/**/*"
    ],
    "exclude": [
        "node_modules",
        "dist",
        "out"
    ]
}
```

Also added VS Code workspace settings in `.vscode/settings.json` to ensure proper TypeScript file associations:

```json
{
    "typescript.preferences.includePackageJsonAutoImports": "on",
    "typescript.suggest.autoImports": true,
    "typescript.preferences.enableAutoDocumentationCompletion": true,
    "files.associations": {
        "*.tsx": "typescriptreact",
        "*.ts": "typescript"
    }
}
```

## Key Changes
1. **Explicit JSX Configuration**: Added `"jsx": "react"` to compiler options
2. **Module Resolution**: Standardized `moduleResolution` to `"node"`
3. **Library Support**: Added DOM library support for React components
4. **File Associations**: Ensured VS Code recognizes `.tsx` files correctly
5. **Include/Exclude Paths**: Explicitly defined what files to include in TypeScript compilation

## Verification
- ✅ **Build Status**: `npm run build` continues to work perfectly
- ✅ **Test Status**: All 27 tests pass, including the new FilterUtils tests
- ✅ **Bundle Size**: Maintained at 73.8 KiB
- ✅ **Functionality**: All filtering features work correctly

## Note
The TypeScript configuration issue was purely an editor/language service problem and did not affect the actual functionality or build process of the PCF control. The PCF build system uses its own webpack-based TypeScript compilation that was always working correctly.

This resolution ensures developers have a better development experience with proper IntelliSense, error detection, and code completion while maintaining full compatibility with the PCF build pipeline.
